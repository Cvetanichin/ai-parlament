# Reconciliation Report — Prompt Orchestration Platform

Per `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 0: no code changes were made while producing this report. It only inventories what exists against what `BUILD_SPEC.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md`, and `PROMPT_ENGINE.md` specify.

## 0.1 Repo structure vs. `BUILD_SPEC.md` §2

**Verdict: spec-only. Zero application code exists for this system anywhere in the repo.**

| BUILD_SPEC.md §2 target | Current state |
|---|---|
| `docs/` (18 spec files + `ADR/` with 15 files) | Present, at `apps/prompt-orchestration-platform/docs/` rather than repo root — a deliberate deviation, not a gap. The repo root's own `docs/` is already the fully-built, unrelated EAS/CSO Playground OS specification (`docs/01-Product-Vision` … `docs/21-ADRs`); putting this system's docs there would have collided both in path and in meaning. All 18 files + 15 ADRs are present and accounted for. |
| `docs/04_PromptLibrary_SystemPromptsStructure.md`, `chat convers.rtf` (cited by `DATABASE.md`, `PROMPT_MODULES.md`, `PROMPT_ENGINE.md` as source material) | **Now present** (added alongside this report) — they were never committed to this repo; found on the Product Owner's local Desktop and added. Confirmed by inspection: `04_PromptLibrary_SystemPromptsStructure.md` (3,719 lines) is a stitched multi-part design conversation that contains, in full: the literal prompt text for all 9 control-plane modules + `SPECIALIST_ME_FRAMEWORK` (§2–10), all remaining v1/v1.1 specialist/validator/formatter prompts (§11–23), 4 example workflow packs (§24), and — critically — an "Exact Airtable field-by-field setup sheet" (line 3435+) that matches `DATABASE.md`'s 11-table Postgres DDL field-for-field with no discrepancies found. This file is buildable source material, not a placeholder. |
| `supabase/migrations/001_init_schema.sql`, `002_seed_core_modules.sql`, `003_add_strict_output_schema.sql` | **Do not exist.** No migration in this repo's `supabase/migrations/` targets any of the 11 tables in `DATABASE.md` §2 (`prompt_modules`, `workflows`, `workflow_steps`, `context_assets`, `routing_rules`, `output_formats`, `validators`, `projects`, `users`, `task_runs`, `run_steps`). See §0.2 below for the important nuance on `prompt_modules` and `projects`. |
| `supabase/functions/orchestrate-task/` (`index.ts`, `types.ts`, `schemas.ts`, `openai.ts`, `routing.ts`, `context.ts`, `validation.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `logger.ts`) | **Do not exist.** `supabase/functions/` in this repo contains only EAS's functions (`workflow-research-run`, `workflow-governance-run`, `workflow-gate-decide`, `eligibility-report-run`, `eligibility-report-get`, `embedding-pipeline-run`) — none relate to this system. See §0.3. |
| `supabase/tests/orchestrator.test.ts` | Does not exist. |
| `frontend/` (React + Tailwind, Phase 3 scope) | Does not exist as scoped. Note: the repo root does have a generic React/Vite/Tailwind scaffold (`src/`, `package.json`, etc.) added in the same upload as this doc set, but inspection confirmed it implements an unrelated "Error Handling Strategy Demo" (network/API/validation error triggers, toast/error-log viewer) — no `orchestrate-task` call, no reference to `task_runs`/`prompt_modules`/workflows anywhere in it. **Do not treat it as Phase 3 starter code; it isn't.** |
| Prior real-world artifact **not** named anywhere in `BUILD_SPEC.md` §2, but directly relevant | `PromptLibraryV7_2.jsx` (Product Owner's `~/Downloads/`, ~1,628 lines, latest of two distinct versions — `V7`/`V7_1` are byte-identical to each other and older; `V7_2` and its two accidental re-download copies are byte-identical to each other and newer). This is a **complete, currently-working, single-file React app** — "Cvetanichin Prompt Library v05" — with 77 real consulting task prompts (`PL-001`…`PL-077`, categories matching `PROMPT_MODULES.md`'s domain list) and 13 system-prompt personas (`SP-001`…`SP-013`+), full CRUD, JSON/CSV/MD import, an AI-assisted "improve this prompt" side panel (calls Anthropic's Messages API directly, client-side, streaming — see §0.3), all persisted to browser `localStorage` under key `cvetanichin-pl-v5`. **This is the actual artifact `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 describes as "existing complexity... trapped in one person's prompt habits"** that this whole system exists to formalize. It is a distinct body of content from `04_PromptLibrary_SystemPromptsStructure.md`'s 22-module orchestration registry: the JSX holds finished, human-facing *deliverable* prompts (specialist-level content); the `.md` file holds the *meta*-prompts that classify/route/plan/validate/format around them. Both are real and both matter for Phase 2 (`SPECIALIST_ME_FRAMEWORK` and friends should plausibly draw on the JSX's `PL-XXX` prompts as worked examples/context, not just the `.md` file's own specialist prompt drafts) — worth a Product Owner call before Phase 2, not a Phase 0 decision. |

## 0.2 Database migrations vs. `DATABASE.md` — schema drift

**Checked against both Supabase projects in this Supabase organisation that are `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`:**

- **`urhocsijfzkepebsmstx` ("cso-playground")** — this is EAS's project (confirmed separately). It already has a table named **`prompt_modules`** (3 rows, RLS `select using (true)`) and a table named **`projects`** (0 rows, project-management domain fields: `client_id`, `budget`, etc.) — **both names collide with two of this system's 11 target table names**, but with completely different schemas and purposes (EAS's `prompt_modules` stores ministry/agent prompts for the Parliament governance system; EAS's `projects` is a CSO grant/project-management entity). **If this system is ever migrated into this same Supabase project, `001_init_schema.sql` cannot be applied as-written — it would either collide or require renaming.** This repo's `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `BUILD_SPEC.md` do not currently name a target Supabase project at all, so this collision is latent, not yet triggered — but it needs a decision before Phase 1's migration is written, not after.
- **`jorpfsrvhnelnboupiyx` ("Consultancy Dashboard")** — EAS's production project; not inspected further here since it shares the same collision profile as above and is even less likely to be this system's intended home (it's the org's paying-customer product).
- **`boiqtfoymcmdgqnfkzjd` ("prompt-architect-pro")** — name strongly suggests this is this system's actual intended Supabase project, created 2026-05-04 (predates the EAS project's 2026-05-13 creation date, consistent with `PROJECT.md`'s framing of an "earlier" effort). **Currently `INACTIVE` (paused).** A `list_tables` call against it timed out while paused. **Its actual schema state is unverified** — it could already contain a partial or full implementation of `DATABASE.md`'s 11 tables (in which case Phase 1.1's migration needs to reconcile against real state, not assume a blank slate, exactly as `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` 0.2 warns), or it could be empty. Resuming a paused Supabase project is a state-changing action with possible billing implications — **not done as part of this report; needs explicit Product Owner go-ahead.**

**Conclusion for 0.2: no migration drift can be assessed with confidence until `prompt-architect-pro` is either confirmed as the target project and resumed for inspection, or explicitly ruled out in favor of a different project.** This is the single highest-priority open question blocking a real Phase 1.1.

## 0.3 Edge Function code vs. `EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md` / `PROMPT_ENGINE.md` (ADR-010 defect check)

**No `orchestrate-task` Edge Function, or any code implementing this system's classify → route → plan → specialist → validate → format pipeline, exists anywhere in this repo or its git history** (confirmed: `git log --all` for any file matching this system's expected filenames returns only today's single spec-upload commit).

`ADR-010`'s stated rationale — "the pre-production runner used generic `json_object` mode and parsed whatever came back, with silent fallback parsing on control-plane steps" — describes a defect in **some prior runner that is not present in this repository**. The only OpenAI/Claude-calling code found anywhere adjacent to this system is `PromptLibraryV7_2.jsx`'s `AIAssistantPanel` (§0.1 above), and it does **not** match this description: it calls Anthropic's Messages API directly (not OpenAI), with `stream: true` and no schema/`json_object` mode at all — it's a free-text streaming assistant, not a control-plane classifier/router. It is not the runner ADR-010 is describing.

**Two possibilities, not resolved by this report:**
1. The "pre-production runner" was hypothetical/illustrative within the design conversation (`chat convers.rtf`) rather than code that was ever actually run — i.e. ADR-010 is arguing against a *risk*, not a *found defect*.
2. It exists in the paused `prompt-architect-pro` project's Edge Functions, unexaminable while paused (same blocker as §0.2).

**Practical effect on Phase 1: none.** Since no runner code exists in this repo to reconcile against, Phase 1's `index.ts`/`schemas.ts`/`openai.ts`/etc. can be written fresh, following `EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md` and `PROMPT_ENGINE.md` exactly as specified — there is nothing here to preserve, migrate, or fix. The ADR-010 defect check specifically called for by `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` 0.3 therefore has a clean answer: **not applicable — no pre-existing runner found in this repo to carry the defect.**

## Summary

| Area | Finding |
|---|---|
| Docs | Complete, relocated, and now buildable (missing source files added) |
| Database | Cannot confirm drift-free — target Supabase project itself is unconfirmed (§0.2) |
| Edge Function code | None exists; Phase 1 is a clean start, no legacy defect to reconcile |
| Prior real-world artifact | `PromptLibraryV7_2.jsx` — real, working, 77+13 prompts, should inform Phase 2 seed content |

## Open decisions before Phase 1 can start (owner confirmation required — `BUILD_SPEC.md` §6)

1. **Target Supabase project.** Is `prompt-architect-pro` (`boiqtfoymcmdgqnfkzjd`) this system's home? If so, it needs resuming (cost-aware) and its actual current schema inspected before `001_init_schema.sql` is written. If not, which project is — a new one, or a shared one with a renaming plan for the `prompt_modules`/`projects` collision?
2. **Relationship between the two prompt sources.** Should `002_seed_core_modules.sql`'s specialist rows (`SPECIALIST_ME_FRAMEWORK` etc.) draw only on `04_PromptLibrary_SystemPromptsStructure.md`'s own specialist-prompt drafts (§9–15), or should they incorporate/reference relevant `PL-XXX` prompts from `PromptLibraryV7_2.jsx` as richer source content?
3. **Fate of `PromptLibraryV7_2.jsx` itself.** It's a real, currently-usable tool with real content and (per its footer) real historical usage. Does it get retired once this system ships, migrated into it as the actual seed data source, or kept running in parallel indefinitely?

**Acceptance gate per `BUILD_SPEC.md` §6: this report needs Product Owner review and explicit confirmation before any Phase 1 task begins.**
